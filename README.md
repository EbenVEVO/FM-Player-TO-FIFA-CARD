# FM-Player-TO-FIFA-CARD
Created a program that reads attribute files from the Football Manager game and converts those stats into stats used on FIFA.


Bridge the gap between Football Manager and FIFA, allowing you to visualize your favorite players' statistics in a format that is familiar and exciting. This program acts as a powerful translator, extracting relevant information from the attribute files and organizing it into a comprehensive FIFA card layout.

The program's user-friendly interface allows you to easily import the attribute files generated by Football Manager and initiate the conversion process with a few simple clicks. FM Player to FIFA Card automatically analyzes the data, maps it to the corresponding FIFA attributes, and generates FIFA card overviews that is similar to what you would see on Ultimate Team sites like FUTBIN.

Instructions:
1. When running, you'll be asked to enter the file path of the attribute file of you can manually choose it.
2. In Football Manager while on a player's page, press Ctrl+P to print out the attribute file and select text file
3. Make sure to name the file the player's name because that is how the program knows the player name
4. Open the .rtf files and convert them to .txt by saving as a txt file
5. Put in the .txt file in the program and your FIFA card overview will be made as long as the program can read it
6. In order for it to be read the player must be fully scouted and has to be printed directly from the game
7. I've left some sample players from my FM save so you can test this program yourself!!!
